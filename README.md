## Welcome to Health Track!

Health Track is a project currently under development and being implemented in Java. It's a health-focused application where the user will be able to record, track and analyze data relating to their health, diet and exercises. It will also be possible to read health articles, nutrition tips and healthy recipes.

It's an academic project for Systems Analysis and Development graduation course, at FIAP college, which allows the student to develop all the processes of building a system, from requirements analysis, database modeling, building prototypes, preparation of documentation, application implementation, testing and deployment.

This project uses Java 11 and Tomcat 9 (MVC with JSP and Java servlets).
Now I'm also using this project to study some Azure cloud services, like Azure App Services, Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage.
